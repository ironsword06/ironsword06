### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My interest in software development and coding, which started as a hobby at first, turned from being a hobby into an area where I want to have a job and a profession. I am currently developing myself in this field 

I have a bachelor's degree in agricultrue engineering and assicote degree in web design and codding . . I knew that if I chose agriculture engineering I would never be good at it. Because finding the motivation to do more and learn more in a field that you do not like is very hard and not sustainable for a long time. We are surrounded by people who do not like their jobs and whine about what they do for a living. I chose the path which I can do with love, passion and will.
